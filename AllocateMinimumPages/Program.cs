// problem Statement
//Given an array arr[] and an integer k, where arr[i] denotes the number of pages of a book and k denotes total number of students. All the books need to be allocated to k students in contiguous manner, with each student getting at least one book.
// The task is to minimize the maximum number of pages allocated to a student. If it is not possible to allocate books to all students, return -1.

////Examples:

//Input: arr[] = [12, 34, 67, 90], k = 2
//Output: 113
//Explanation: Books can be distributed in following ways:

//• [12] and [34, 67, 90] – The maximum pages assigned to a student is 34 + 67 + 90 = 191.
//• [12, 34] and [67, 90] – The maximum pages assigned to a student is 67 + 90 = 157.
//• [12, 34, 67] and [90] – The maximum pages assigned to a student is 12 + 34 + 67 = 113.
//The third combination has the minimum pages assigned to a student which is 113.

//Input: arr[] = [15, 17, 20], k = 5
//Output: -1
//Explanation: Since there are more students than total books, it’s impossible to allocate a book to each student.

//Input: arr[] = [22, 23, 67], k = 1
//Output: 112
//Explanation: Since there is only 1 student, all books are assigned to that student. So, maximum pages assigned to a student is 22 + 23 + 67 = 112.
//nput: arr[] = [12, 34, 67, 90], k = 2
//Output: 113
